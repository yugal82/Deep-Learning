Before building any deep learning model, we first need to know what type of data or in what format that the model expects as input.
If we don't know what is the expected type of data (such as 2d array, 3d array, etc.), then it would be impossible to train the model.

Sequential Model:
    model = keras.Sequential()

To train the sequential model, we use the fit() method. And the fit() method requires the following parameters:
    fit(X, y)
This model expects the format of the data (x and y) to be a numpy array (or tensorflow tensor, dict mapping, tf.data dataset)
